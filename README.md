This repository contains a list of pet projects. The goal is to learn/train to apply data science skills.

Projects are following: 
## 1. Decition tree and data exploration with titanic dataset 
```diff
Data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data
```
Explore and preprocess dataset, implement decision tree model with metrics.

## 2. Gridsearch for decition tree with titanic dataset 
```diff
Data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data
```
Use gridsearch to estimate better values for hyperparameters. Use mlflow to log the best experiments. Use pipelines to compare different preprocessing steps. Compare several boosting algorithms' performance.

## 3. Analysis of time series
```diff
Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chirag19/air-passengers 
```
Use statistical models to predict future value based on time series data. Explore stationarity, and compare models.

## 4. Comparison of experiment group with control group

Explore and preprocess dataset, compare research and control groups by different parameters, visually, and check the statistical significance of the difference.

## 5. Image classification
```diff
Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/muffin-vs-chihuahua-image-classification 
```
Neural networks for image binary classification task.

## 6. Pointcloud processing
```diff
Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/modelnet40-princeton-3d-object-dataset 
```
Classification pointclouds with neural network models.
