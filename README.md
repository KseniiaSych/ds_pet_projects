This repository contains list of pet projects. The goal is to learn/train to apply data science skills.

Projects are following: 
## 1. Decition tree and data exploration with titanic dataset 
```diff
Data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data
```
Expolre and preprocess dataset, implement decision tree model with metrics

## 2. Gridsearch for decition tree with titanic dataset 
```diff
Data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data
```
Use gridsearch to estimate better values for hyperparameters. Use mlflow to log best experiments. Use pipelines to compare different preprocess steps. Compare several boosting algorithms performance.

## 3. Analysis of time series
```diff
Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chirag19/air-passengers 
```
Use statistical models to predict future value based on time series data. Explore stationarity, compare models.

## 4. Comparison of experiment group with control group

Expolre and preprocess dataset, compare research and control groups by different parameters, visually and check statistical significancy on the difference.
