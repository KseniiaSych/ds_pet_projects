This repository contains list of pet projects. The goal is to learn/train to apply data science skills.

Projects are following: 
1. Decition tree and data exploration with titanic dataset \
```diff
# Data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data</span> \ 
```
Expolre and preprocess dataset, implement decision tree model with metrics
2. Gridsearch for decition tree with titanic dataset \
```diff
# Data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data</span> \ 
```
Use gridsearch to estimate better values for hyperparameters. Use mlflow to log best experiments. Use pipelines to compare different preprocess steps. Compare several boosting algorithms performance.

3. Analysis of time series \
```diff
# Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chirag19/air-passengers</span> \ 
```
Use statistical models to predict future value based on time series data. Explore stationarity, compare models.
